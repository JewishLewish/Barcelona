# Barcelona's Features

## The Simplicity of mySQL
Barcelona aims to make database systems more easier to manage and counter the complexities that mySQL gives.

## The Performance of Lua
Barcelona, simiiar to Lua, uses a very small syntax. Allowing for Barcelona to operate at a very small cost. 

## The Efficiency of Rust
Barcelona, inspired by Rust, uses a smarter memory system and allows users to control / create variables while the code is running.
